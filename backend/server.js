//Purpose: This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.
//How it works: When a client sends a request with a JSON payload (common in API requests),
// this middleware parses the JSON data and makes it available in the req.body object for further processing in your application.
app.use(express.static("public"));
//Purpose: This middleware is responsible for serving static files, such as HTML, CSS, images, etc.,
//from a specified directory. In this case, it serves files from the 'public' directory.

//How it works: When a request is made for a static file (e.g., an image or a CSS file),
// Express looks in the specified directory and sends the file back to the client

//Purpose: This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies in URL-encoded form data.
//How it works: When a client submits a form with the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type (common in HTML forms),
// this middleware parses the form data and makes it available in the req.body object.
//The extended: true option allows for parsing complex objects and arrays in the URL-encoded data.
